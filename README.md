# README Generator

## Description
Creating this project is a great way for me to gain experience using Node.js. Creating this project will be a helpful tool for me at the end of each of my next projects to help me create a professional READme. I learned how to use Node.js more effectively with this project, and understand how switch statements are a useful tool to use instead of an if statement.
